## Introduction

Computer networking is the practice of connecting multiple computing devices together to share resources and information. It enables communication and data exchange between computers, servers, printers, and other devices within a network. Networking technologies form the foundation of modern IT infrastructure and facilitate various functions, including communication, resource sharing, internet access, and data storage.

## Key Concepts

- **Network Layers**: Understanding the OSI model and TCP/IP protocol suite.
- **IP Addressing and Subnetting**: Basics of IPv4 and IPv6 addressing, subnetting, and CIDR notation.
- **Routing and Switching**: Concepts of routing, switching, and VLANs.
- **Network Security**: Fundamentals of network security, including firewalls, encryption, and access controls.
- **Wireless Networking**: Basics of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks.

## Networking Protocols

- **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**: Core protocol suite of the internet.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Connectionless transport protocol for lightweight communication.
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: Protocol for transferring hypertext requests and responses.
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: Standard network protocol for transferring files.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Hierarchical and decentralized naming system for resources connected to the internet.
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: Protocol for email transmission.

## Network Devices

- **Routers**: Devices that forward data packets between computer networks.
- **Switches**: Devices that connect devices within a network and facilitate data transmission.
- **Hubs**: Simple networking devices that connect multiple Ethernet devices together.
- **Firewalls**: Network security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
- **Access Points**: Devices that enable wireless devices to connect to a wired network.

## Network Topologies

- **Bus Topology**: All devices are connected to a single cable.
- **Star Topology**: All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.
- **Ring Topology**: Devices are connected in a circular chain.
- **Mesh Topology**: Devices are connected with multiple redundant paths.
- **Hybrid Topology**: Combination of two or more basic network topologies.

## Wireless Networking

- **Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)**: Wireless networking technology based on IEEE 802.11 standards.
- **Bluetooth**: Short-range wireless technology for connecting devices over short distances.
- **Cellular Networks**: Mobile communication networks based on cellular technology.

## Internet

- **Internet Protocols**: Basics of TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, and other internet protocols.
- **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**: Companies that provide internet access to users.
- **Domain Names and Web Hosting**: Basics of domain names, web hosting, and DNS management.

## Network Security

- **Firewalls**: Devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
- **Encryption**: Techniques for encoding data to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Access Controls**: Mechanisms for restricting access to network resources.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Systems that monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.
- **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**: Secure and encrypted connections over public networks.
